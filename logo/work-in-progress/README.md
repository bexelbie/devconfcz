## SVG source

This SVG work-in-progress (WIP) requires the Montserrat font to be installed *before* you launch Inkscape (and, of course, I can only guarantee it works in Inkscape at the moment). Also, it's a bit of a mess at the moment, with overlapping shapes to hide various paths and such — the plan is to more properly work on the glyphs and produce a cleaned version after we decide on a near-final variant.


### Montserrat — the font needed by the SVG 

You can install Montserrat by doing one of the following:

1. search for Montserrat in the GNOME Software "app store"

2. running the following in Fedora:
sudo dnf install julietaula-montserrat-fonts

3. ...or by installing the bold and regular OTFs from:
https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat/tree/master/otf

Please note that you MUST have Montserrat installed and working before you attempt to open the SVG in Inkscape.
